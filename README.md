After downloading the code, you will need to complete the steps below.

In order for any http requests to successfully send requests, you need to run a local npmjs http-server, rather than opening up the html files directly in your browser. Setup steps can be found here: 
https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server

Also, in order to make EXTERNAL http requests successfully, you need to enable cross-origin resource sharing. You can download this Google Chrome plug-in, which can enable that: 
"Allow-Control-Allow-Origin: *" from vitvad (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-control-allow-origi/nlfbmbojpeacfghkpbjhddihlkkiljbi?hl=en)
